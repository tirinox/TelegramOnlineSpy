  Uses Telethon library to check online status and if it was changed. 
  If changes are detected, a bot will send you a message.

---

## How it works

 The `spy.py` will host a bot that you can interact with.
 On Telegram you chat with the bot and through the bot commands you add/remove users on the monitoring list.

 The bot will message you, if any of the users on the list changed their online status.

## Install

` pip install telethon`
 
## Setup

Create your telegramm application on https://my.telegram.org/apps and replace API_HASH, API_ID with yours.

Create `.env` file in the same directory as `spy.py` and fill it with your data.
```
API_HASH="your api hash"
API_ID=1223
BOT_TOKEN="your bot token"
```

Create bot in your telegram client (write a message to @BotFather) and copy bot token into app.

## Run

  `python3 spy.py`
  
  Then input **your telegram account number** which will be sending requests to get users online status. Do not enter a bot token as this will not work.
  
  Input  code in console from telegram.
  
### Commands
  
  Write /help to your bot to see usage information.

### Cronjob

Handy cronjob makros

- start background process:

#!/bin/bash
cd /home/DIRECTORY/TelegramOnlineSpy
nohup python3 spy.py > nohupper.log &

- check if background process is still running

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /home/DIRECTORY/TelegramOnlineSpy
minimum_finds=2
found=$(ps aux | grep "python3 spy.py" | wc -l)
if ((found < minimum_finds)); then
   # DO SOMETHING WHEN YOUR SPY IS OFFLINE
   # eg. alert the user or restart the spy
fi
```

check if spy is running every hour

```bash
32 * * * * /home/DIRECTORY/TelegramOnlineSpy/checkrunning.sh
```
